\subsection{Data Loading and Cleaning}

The raw data from \texttt{2026\_MCM\_Problem\_C\_Data.csv} required preprocessing to handle:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Missing values (N/A) for weeks not run in a season
    \item Zero scores for eliminated contestants in subsequent weeks
    \item Variable number of judges per week (usually 3, sometimes 4)
    \item Decimal scores due to multiple dances or bonus points
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Weekly Score Calculation}

For each week, we calculated:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Total Judge Score}: Sum of all judge scores for each contestant
    \item \textbf{Judge Rank}: Ranking based on total judge score (1 = best, N = worst)
    \item \textbf{Judge Percent}: Percentage of total judge scores
\end{itemize}

The preprocessing module (\texttt{preprocess\_dwts.py}) handles all these calculations automatically.

\subsection{Season and Week Identification}

We identified:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Total of 34 seasons
    \item 299 elimination weeks across all seasons
    \item Variable number of contestants per season (ranging from 6 to 16)
    \item Variable number of weeks per season (ranging from 5 to 11)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Output}

The preprocessing produces \texttt{2026\_MCM\_Problem\_C\_Data\_processed.csv}, which contains:
\begin{itemize}
    \item All original contestant information
    \item Weekly judge scores and totals
    \item Weekly rankings and percentages
    \item Season and week identifiers
\end{itemize}

This processed data serves as the foundation for all subsequent analyses.
