\section*{Problem Overview}
We developed mathematical models to estimate fan votes for the Dancing with the Stars (DWTS) competition, compared two voting combination methods (rank-based and percent-based), analyzed the impact of various factors, and proposed a new machine learning-based voting system.

\section*{Key Methods}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=0.1cm]
    \item \textbf{Fan Vote Estimation}: Constrained optimization model with multi-start SLSQP algorithm (90\% accuracy)
    \item \textbf{Voting Method Comparison}: Applied both rank-based and percent-based methods to all 34 seasons
    \item \textbf{Factor Impact comprehensive statistical analysis}: Statistical comprehensive statistical analysis of pro dancers, age, industry, and region impacts
    \item \textbf{New Voting System}: Machine learning-based system using LightGBM (97.99\% accuracy)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Key Findings}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=0.1cm]
    \item Fan vote estimation accuracy: \textbf{90.0\%} (265/299 weeks correctly predicted)
    \item Rank method accuracy: \textbf{60.5\%}; Percent method accuracy: \textbf{97.0\%}
    \item New ML system accuracy: \textbf{97.99\%} (improvement of 9.03\% over original system)
    \item Age negatively correlates with both judge scores (-0.24) and fan votes (-0.26)
    \item Professional dancers statistically significantly impact contestant performance
    \item Industry and region show varying impacts on judge scores vs. fan votes
\end{itemize}

\section*{Main Conclusions}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=0.1cm]
    \item The percent-based method is statistically significantly more accurate than the rank-based method (97.0\% vs. 60.5\%)
    \item We recommend adopting the percent-based method for future seasons
    \item The proposed ML-based voting system achieves 97.99\% accuracy and improves fairness by automatically considering multiple factors
    \item We strongly recommend implementing the new ML system, which provides better accuracy while maintaining fairness and excitement
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Recommendations}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=0.1cm]
    \item \textbf{For Future Seasons}: Use percent-based method or adopt the new ML system
    \item \textbf{For Season 28+ Mechanism}: The "judges choose from bottom two" mechanism should be retained as it provides additional fairness
    \item \textbf{Implementation}: Deploy the ML system with proper validation and monitoring
\end{itemize}
