\subsection{Data Loading and Cleaning}

The raw data required preprocessing to handle missing values (N/A for weeks not run), zero scores (eliminated contestants), and varying numbers of judges (typically 3, occasionally 4). Decimal scores arise from multiple dances, bonus points, or team performances.

\subsection{Weekly Score Calculation}

For each week $w$ and contestant $i$, we compute:
\begin{itemize}
\item Total judge score: $S_i^{(w)} = \sum_{j=1}^{J^{(w)}} s_{i,j}^{(w)}$
\item Judge rank: $R_{\text{judge}}^{(w)}(i)$ (descending order, rank 1 = highest)
\item Judge percentage: $P_{\text{judge}}^{(w)}(i) = S_i^{(w)} / \sum_{k} S_k^{(w)}$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Season and Week Identification}

We identified 34 seasons with 299 elimination weeks. Season identification uses the \texttt{season} column. Week identification extracts from the \texttt{results} column (e.g., "Eliminated Week 2") or infers from final placements.

\subsection{Output and Data Quality}

The preprocessing produces \texttt{2026\_MCM\_Problem\_C\_Data\_processed.csv} with computed metrics. Data quality checks verify rank sums and percentage unity, ensuring data integrity.
