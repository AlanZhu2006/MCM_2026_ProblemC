High-fidelity scientific schematic diagram titled "Figure 1: The structure of our paper", technical vector illustration, clean white background, academic textbook style, ultra-high resolution 8K (7680×4320 pixels), strictly 2D flat design. Professional color coding: Azure Blue (#4A90E2) for data preprocessing, Slate Grey (#708090) for estimation, Coral Orange (#FF7F50) for comparison, Forest Green (#228B22) for analysis, Deep Purple (#6A5ACD) for ML system. Clean thin outlines, soft pastel fills, NO shadows, NO 3D effects, NOT hand-drawn. Sharp, crisp lines and text for maximum clarity.

The diagram illustrates a pipeline for analyzing DWTS voting system with five main sections labeled (a) through (e).

[Section (a) - Data Preprocessing - Azure Blue Block, Left Side]

Top: "DWTS" logo, followed by "Raw Competition Data" showing "[34 Seasons, 299 Weeks]".

Middle: Arrow to "Data Correction" with three blocks:
- "[Missing Value Handling]"
- "[Score Calculation]"
- "[Data Validation]"

Bottom: Two outputs:
- "[Processed Dataset]" (arrow right)
- "[Feature Matrix]" (arrow down to Section (e))

[Section (e) - Contestant Attributes - Forest Green Block, Bottom Left]

Four attribute boxes:
- "[Age]"
- "[Industry]"
- "[Region]"
- "[Professional Dancer]"

Output arrow "[Contestant Attributes]" connects to Sections (b) and (d).

[Section (b) - Task 1: Fan Vote Estimation - Slate Grey Block, Top Right]

Three sub-sections:

1. "Constraint Optimization"
- Inputs: "[Processed Dataset]" and "[Elimination Results]"
- "[Rank-based: R_judge + R_fan ≥ max]"
- "[Percent-based: P_judge + P_fan ≤ min]"
- "[Expected Vote Model: v̂ = α₀ + Σαⱼφⱼ]"
- "[Objective: min Σw(v - v̂)²]"

2. "Optimization Algorithm"
- "[Multi-start SLSQP]" (8 initial guesses)
  - Self-loop: "[Restart if Failed]"
- "[Differential Evolution]" (fallback)
- Output: "[Optimized Fan Votes]"

3. "Validation"
- "[Elimination Prediction]" → Badge: "[90.0% Accuracy]"
- "[Monte Carlo Simulation]" (500 iterations) → "[Uncertainty Analysis]"

Output: "[Fan Vote Estimates]" (arrow right to Section (c))

Feedback: Curved arrow from "[90.0% Accuracy]" back to "[Expected Vote Model]".

[Section (c) - Task 2: Voting Method Comparison - Coral Orange Block, Middle Right]

Two parallel methods:

Method 1: "[Rank-based Method]"
- "[Judge Ranks + Fan Ranks]"
- Badge: "[60.5% Accuracy]"

Method 2: "[Percent-based Method]"
- "[Judge Percentages + Fan Percentages]"
- Badge: "[97.0% Accuracy]"

Comparison:
- "[Agreement: 62.54%]"
- "[Disagreement: 37.46%]"

Controversial Cases (4 icons):
- "[Jerry Rice (S2)]"
- "[Billy Ray Cyrus (S4)]"
- "[Bristol Palin (S11)]"
- "[Bobby Bones (S27)]"

Output: "[Comparison Results]" (arrow right to Section (d))

Feedback: Curved arrow from "[Controversial Cases]" back to Section (b).

[Section (d) - Task 3: Factor Impact Analysis - Forest Green Block, Bottom Right]

Factor Extraction (4 factors):
- "[Professional Dancers]"
- "[Age]"
- "[Industry]"
- "[Region]"

Two Analysis Paths:
- "[Judge Score Impact]": "[Pro Dancer: d=1.24, Age: r=-0.24, Industry: d=0.72, Region: d=0.31]"
- "[Fan Vote Impact]": "[Pro Dancer: d=0.68, Age: r=-0.26, Industry: d=1.15, Region: d=0.58]"

Output: "[Differential Impact Report]" (arrow right to Section (f))

Feedback: Curved arrow back to Section (b).

[Section (f) - Task 4: New Voting System - Deep Purple Block, Far Right]

Feature Engineering:
- Inputs: "[Fan Vote Estimates]", "[Contestant Attributes]", "[Differential Impact]"
- "[12-D Feature Vector: x ∈ ℝ¹²]"

Model Architecture:
- "[LightGBM Gradient Boosting]"
- "[Input: 12 features] → [Decision Trees] → [Output: P(eliminated | x)]"

Training:
- "[Time-series Cross-Validation]"
- "[Loss: Cross-Entropy + L2 Regularization]"
- Badges: "[Training: 99.65%]", "[CV: 99.56%]", "[Prediction: 97.99%]"

Feature Importance:
- Top: "[Fan Votes: 23.99%, Fan Relative: 15.52%, Fan Rank: 14.72%]"

Output: "[System Proposal]"

Feedback: Curved arrow from "[97.99% Accuracy]" back to Section (b).
