\section*{Memo to Producers of Dancing with the Stars}

\subsection*{Executive Summary}

After comprehensive analysis of 34 seasons of DWTS data, we recommend adopting a \textbf{percent-based voting method} for future seasons, and strongly suggest implementing our proposed \textbf{machine learning-based intelligent voting system} for optimal results.

\subsection*{Key Findings}

\subsubsection*{Current System Performance}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Current system (rank-based/percent-based) accuracy: \textbf{88.96\%}
    \item Percent-based method accuracy: \textbf{97.0\%} (significantly better than rank-based: 60.5\%)
    \item The choice of voting method matters: 37.46\% of weeks show different results
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{New System Performance}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Proposed ML system accuracy: \textbf{97.99\%}
    \item Improvement: \textbf{+9.03\%} over current system
    \item Additional benefits: Better fairness, reduced controversy, maintained excitement
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Why Percent-Based Method?}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Higher Accuracy}: 97.0\% vs. 60.5\% for rank-based method
    \item \textbf{Better Fan Representation}: Allows high fan support to compensate for low judge scores
    \item \textbf{Proven Track Record}: Used successfully in Seasons 3-27
    \item \textbf{Handles Controversial Cases Better}: Protects popular contestants with low judge scores (e.g., Jerry Rice, Bobby Bones)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Why ML-Based System?}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Highest Accuracy}: 97.99\% - best of all methods tested
    \item \textbf{Automatic Fairness}: Considers age, professional dancer, industry, region automatically
    \item \textbf{Adaptive}: Learns optimal weights and adapts to different seasons
    \item \textbf{Reduced Controversy}: More accurate predictions mean fewer "unfair" eliminations
    \item \textbf{Maintained Excitement}: Still prioritizes fan votes (62.7\% importance), keeping audience engaged
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Implementation Recommendations}

\subsubsection*{Short-term (Next Season)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Switch to percent-based method (if not already using it)
    \item Retain the "judges choose from bottom two" mechanism (Season 28+)
    \item Consider a hybrid: Use percent-based to identify bottom two, then let judges decide
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Long-term (1-2 Seasons)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Pilot the ML-based system in 1-2 seasons
    \item Monitor performance and collect feedback
    \item Gradually expand implementation
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Expected Benefits}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Accuracy}: 9.03\% improvement in elimination prediction
    \item \textbf{Fairness}: Automatic consideration of multiple factors reduces bias
    \item \textbf{Controversy Reduction}: More accurate predictions mean fewer disputed eliminations
    \item \textbf{Audience Satisfaction}: Better balance between fan votes and judge scores
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Risk Assessment}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Overfitting Risk}: Low - validated with time-series cross-validation
    \item \textbf{Data Dependency}: Medium - requires historical data, but we have 34 seasons
    \item \textbf{Explainability}: Medium - can provide feature importance, but less transparent than simple methods
    \item \textbf{Mitigation}: Keep original system as backup, provide feature importance explanations
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Next Steps}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Review this analysis with production team
    \item Decide on immediate action (percent-based method)
    \item Plan ML system pilot program
    \item Allocate resources for implementation
    \item Set up monitoring and evaluation framework
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Conclusion}

The data clearly shows that the percent-based method is superior to the rank-based method, and our proposed ML system offers the best combination of accuracy, fairness, and excitement. We strongly recommend adopting these improvements to enhance the show's integrity and audience satisfaction.
